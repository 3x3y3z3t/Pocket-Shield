This is the official repository for Pocket Shield mod for Keen Software House's "Space Engineers" game.\
This mod will be a part of my "Back to the reality" modpack? challenge?, in which the Engineer stays on Earthlike planet most of their time.

This mod add a personal shield generator, Pocket Shield, to character.\
Any characters (Enginners, Wolves, Spiders, AI Enabled Bots, ...) can benefit from this shield if they have the Shield Emitter item in their inventory.

Functionality is powered by [Pocket Shield Core](https://github.com/3x3y3z3t/Pocket-Shield-Core)
